# reactjs-robotfriends
My first ReactJS app - RobotFriends
By building this app, I learned:
1. one-way data passing using props
2. how states are updated
3. basic ideas about react components and life cycles (particularly constructor() and   componentDidMount() )
4. how to create "wrapper" component and use props.children (which can be useful for creating layout components)
5. basic features that most websites are built with: rendering a list of items, searching particular items
6. how cool  ReactJS is!
7. that building a web app to production may be overwhelming, but it makes me sort of satisfied when getting it done!
